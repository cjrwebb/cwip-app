Children looked after in England including adoption: 2018 to 2019

Overview

This publication provides information about children looked after (CLA) in England for the year 
ending 31 March 2019.  The figures are based on data collected annually through the Children 
Looked After data collection which is completed each spring by all local authorities in England.  
Further details on which children are included in the data collection can be found in the children 
looked after return 2018-19 collection guide:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/children-looked-after-return-2018-to-2019-guide.

National totals are derived by summing data provided by each LA and then applying rounding and 
suppression.  The sum of each LA will not necessarily match national totals as a result.

Regional totals are derived by summing data for each LA within that region and then applying 
rounding and suppression.  The sum of regional totals will not necessarily match the national total as 
a result.

LA level data are data as returned by each LA and have been suppressed or secondary suppressed 
where necessary.

Rounding and suppression: To ensure that no individual can be identified, we use conventions for 
the rounding and suppression of small numbers.  National and regional totals have been rounded to 
the nearest 10.  Percentages and rates have been rounded to the nearest whole number.  Averages 
have been rounded to one decimal place

For confidentiality purposes, small numbers and any percentages or averages based on them have 
been suppressed and replaced by the letter (c).  Where any number is shown as zero (0), the original 
figure submitted was zero (0).  It has been necessary to suppress other figures whenever it would be 
possible to calculate the value of a suppressed number by means of simple arithmetic.  The rule 
applied in these circumstances has been to suppress the next smallest data item.  Where data is not 
available it is reported as ‘..’.

Unless otherwise stated, numbers and percentage exclude children looked after under an agreed 
series of short term placements.  Historical data may differ from older publications.  This is mainly 
due to the implementation of amendments and corrections sent by some local authorities and after 
the publication date of previous materials.

Data usage notes – further information is available in the CLA guide published alongside the release:

1: Isles of Scilly local authority do not have any looked after children and so are not included in 
underlying data files.

2: In order to allow users maximum flexibility to aggregate data to meet their own purposes, LA level 
data has been shown to the nearest whole number.

3: The LA_order field can be used to display the data in all files to the published regional and local 
authority order.

4: Missing2019.csv and CareLeavers17182019.csv, and the 11 data items ‘CLA_RPC’ in the file 
CLA2019.csv are experimental statistics and users should be cautious interpreting the data.

[1] The rates per 10,000 children under 18 years have been derived using the most recent mid-year 
population estimates provided by the Office for National Statistics (June 2019). For example, in 
Ceased_CLA_Rate2019 we use detailed annual mid-year population estimates for the UK, local 
authorities prior to April 2019.
[2] Children looked after exclusively under one or more agreed series of short term placements at 
any time during the years ending 31 March.  These figures exclude children who have been looked 
after under both a series of short term placements and other legal statuses during the year.
[3] For some local authorities, such as Kent, the figures may be impacted by significant numbers of 
unaccompanied asylum seeking children.
[4] Information refused or not yet obtained.
[5] The description of these placement types has changed to provide clarity on the type of 
accommodation the children are living in.  There has not been any change to the data collection and 
the figures are not affected.
[6] No new applications for freeing orders may be made on or after 30 December 2005.
[7] Placement orders came into force on 30 December 2005.
[8] These are children under police protection and in local authority accommodation, children 
subject to emergency protection orders and children under child assessment orders and in local 
authority accommodation.
[9] These are children on remand or committed for trial, children detained in local authority 
accommodation under section 38(6) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and children 
sentenced to CYPA 1969 supervision orders with residence requirement.
[10] A placement provider does not apply to children who are placed with parents.
[11] Placement provider not reported.  This includes children who are reported missing from their

[1]  Only the first occasion on which a child started to be looked after in the year has been counted.
[2]  Children who were taken into care are children who started to be looked after under a care 
order, a police protection order, an emergency protection order or a child assessment order.
[3]  For some local authorities, such as Kent, the figures may be impacted by significant numbers of 
unaccompanied asylum seeking children.
[4]  Placement orders came into force on 30 December 2005.
[5] The rates per 10,000 children under 18 years have been derived using the most recent mid-year 
population estimates provided by the Office for National Statistics (June 2019). For example, in 
Started_CLA_Rate2019 we use detailed annual mid-year population estimates for the UK, local 
authorities prior to April 2019.

[1]  Figures exclude children who have died since leaving care and those who have returned home to 
parents or someone with parental responsibility for a continuous period of at least 6 months.
[2]  Information on 17 and 18 year old care leavers was collected for the first time in 2016.  
[3]  These figures also exclude young people who have gone abroad, been deported, or their 
residence is not known, as in these cases, the suitability of the accommodation will be unknown.
[4]  Regulation 9(2) of the Care Leavers Regulations defines what is meant by ‘suitable 
accommodation’.
[5]  Includes children whose accommodation is not known because either the local authority is not in 
touch, or the young person has refused contact or no longer requires services.
[6]  With parents or relatives is likely to be an undercount.  If the young person’s former foster carer 
is a relative, they should be recorded as accommodated with their former foster carer.
[7]  Includes young people whose accommodation is not known because either the local authority is 
not in touch, or the young person has refused contact or no longer requires services.

[1]  Figures exclude children who have died since leaving care and those who have returned home to 
parents or someone with parental responsibility for a continuous period of at least 6 months.
[2]  These figures also exclude young people who have gone abroad, been deported, or their 
residence is not known, as in these cases, the suitability of the accommodation will be unknown
[3]  Regulation 9(2) of the Care Leavers Regulations defines what is meant by ‘suitable 
accommodation’.
[4]  Includes children whose accommodation is not known because either the local authority is not in 
touch, or the young person has refused contact or no longer requires services.
[5]  With parents or relatives is likely to be an undercount.  If the young person’s former foster carer 
is a relative, they should be recorded as accommodated with their former foster carer.
[6]  Includes young people whose accommodation is not known because either the local authority is

[1] Missing is defined as a looked after child who is not at their placement or a place they are 
expected to be (e.g. school) and their whereabouts is not known.
[2] This is the fifth year these statistics have been collected in this way, and local authorities have 
reported some improvements in recording.  However, there are still concerns over the quality as not 
all local authorities have reported incidents of ‘away without authorisation’ [see footnote 7].
[3] Includes children who were missing or away from placement without authorisation at 1 April 
2018, therefore carried over from previous years.
[4] The average number of missing or away from placement without authorisation incidents for each 
looked after child with at least one incident during the year.
[5] Children who had more than one missing or away from placement without authorisation incident 
which started during the year ending 31 March 2019.
[6] Away from placement without authorisation is defined as a looked after child whose 
whereabouts is known but who is not at their placement or place they are expected to be and the 
carer has concerns or the incident has been notified to the local authority or the police.
[7] Since 2017, some local authorities informed the department that they do not record incidents as 
‘away without authorisation’ but instead report all incidents as ‘missing’ to maintain consistency 
with local police reporting.  We estimate this could mean an overestimate of missing incidents of up 
to 3% in 2017, 8% in 2018 and 10% in 2019 suggesting the true number of children with a missing 
incident is likely to have increase more modestly than the published numbers suggest.

[1]  Children of all ages who have been continuously looked after for at least 12 months.
[2]  Information on substance misuse is collected for children looked after continuously for at least 
12 months as at 31 March.
[3]  Offending data is collected for children aged 10 or over who have been looked after continuously 
for at least 12 months as at 31 March.
[4]  This includes children who were convicted or subject to a final warning or reprimand under the 
Crime and Disorder Act 1998 during the year for an offence committed while being looked after.
[5]  The term ‘drug’ is used to refer to any psychotropic substance, including illegal drugs, illicit use 
of prescription drugs and volatile substances.  Young people’s drug taking is often inextricably linked 
with the consumption of alcohol.  Therefore the term ‘substance’ refers to both drugs and alcohol 
but not tobacco.  Substance misuse is defined as ‘intoxication by (or regular excessive consumption 
and/or dependence on) psychoactive substances, leading to social, psychological, physical or legal 
problems’.  It includes problematic use of both legal and illegal drugs (including alcohol when used in 
combination with other substances).
[6]  Children identified as having a substance misuse problem who received an intervention.
[7]  Children identified as having a substance misuse problem who were offered an intervention but 
refused it.
[8]  Immunisations were up to date by the end of 31 March 2019.  ‘Up to date’ means that by 31 
March the child has had all of the immunisations that a child of their age should have received, 
according to the immunisations timetable reproduced by the Department of Health and Social Care 
which is available via the following link:
http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/vaccinations/Pages/Vaccinationchecklist.aspx.
[9]  Records whether the child had their teeth checked by a dentist during the year ending 31 March 
2019.
[10]  Records whether the child received their annual health assessment from a doctor or other 
suitably qualified professional during the year ending 31 March 2019.  Health Assessments must be 
carried out twice a year for those under 5 years of age.  Both of these assessments must be carried 
out in order for the Annual Assessment requirement to be satisfied for under 5s.  The assessment 
should be carried out once in every period of six months before the child’s fifth birthday.  This means 
that one assessment should be carried out in the first six months and one in the second six months.  
For those aged 5 or over, a single annual assessment fulfils the requirement.
[11]  Development assessment data is collected for children aged 4 and under at 31 March who were 
looked after continuously for at least 12 months.  This measures whether the child’s Health 
Surveillance or Health Promotion Checks were up-to-date.
[12]  Children looked after continuously for at least 12 months and aged 5 to 16 for whom an SDQ 
score was received via the looked after children return (SSDA903).  An SDQ score is required of all 
children aged 4 to 16 on the date of the last assessment.  The date of assessment is not collected on 
the looked after children return and therefore this cohort has been restricted to age 5 to 16 as at 31 
March.
