Characteristics of children in need
2020 Reporting Year

Description

This page describes the data included in the ‘Characteristics of children in need’ National Statistics release's underlying data files. This data is released under the terms of the Open Government License and it intended to meet at least 3 stars for Open Data.

The methodology should be referenced alongside this data. It provides information on the data sources, their coverage and quality as well as explaining methodology used in producing the data.

Coverage

This release provides information on:

- children in need of social services
- children referred to social services
- assessments undertaken, primary need at assessment and factors identified at the end of assessment
- section 47 enquiries (a local authority carries out one of these if they suspect a child is suffering, or likely to suffer, significant harm) and initial child protection conferences
- children who were the subject of a child protection plan

These statistics are based on child-level data collected via the children in need census.

File formats and conventions

Confidentiality

In this publication, any number between 1 and 5 inclusive has been suppressed and replaced by ‘c’.  Secondary suppression has been applied where necessary, to preserve confidentiality.

The symbol ‘:’ indicates that data is not available. This may be because a local authority was unable to return a particular data item in the children in need census; changes to the data collected in the census; or data is not available because of concerns regarding quality.

The letter ‘z’ indicates data is not applicable.

The symbols used are in accordance with the latest Government Statistical Service (GSS) guidance.

Rounding

England and regional totals are rounded to the nearest 10, therefore sub totals may not sum to totals.

Percentages are rounded to one decimal place, therefore sub totals may not sum to 100.

Rates per 10,000 children aged under 18 years are rounded to one decimal place. Rates are calculated using ONS mid-year population estimates for children aged 0 to 17 years in England.

Footnotes:

1. A referral is defined as a request for services to be provided by children’s social care and is in respect of a child who is not currently in need.
2. Recording of referral outcomes varies between local authorities, because of differences in local reporting practices. This means there may be considerable variation at local authority level in the number of referrals recorded as no further action, and those resulting in an assessment and the child was assessed not to be in need.
3. If a child has more than one referral in a reporting year, then each referral is counted.
4. Rates per 10,000 of the population of children aged under 18 years are calculated using Office for National Statistics (ONS) mid-year population estimates for children aged 0 to 17 years in England.
5. Re-referrals for the year ending 31 March 2020 exclude Dorset and Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole local authorities due to the reorganisation of these areas from 1 April 2019. This means national re-referral figures for 2020 are not directly comparable with earlier years.

Footnotes:

1.

For cases transferred in from another local authority, the duration is calculated as time in working days between the referral date and the date of the initial child protection conference.
2. If a local authority identifies there is reasonable cause to suspect the child is suffering, or is likely to suffer significant harm, it will carry out an assessment under section 47 of the Children Act 1989 to determine if it needs to take steps to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child.
3. If concerns regarding a child’s welfare are substantiated as result of a section 47 enquiry and the child is judged to be at continuing risk of harm then an initial child protection conference (ICPC) should be convened within 15 working days.
4. Rates per 10,000 of the population of children aged under 18 years are calculated using Office for National Statistics (ONS) mid-year population estimates for children aged 0 to 17 years in England.
