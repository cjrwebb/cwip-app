“Children In Need in England, including their characteristics and further information on children who were the subject of a child protection plan (2009-10 Children in Need census, Final), OSR28-2010


Background

This release of Experimental Statistics provides final figures on the numbers of children referred to and assessed by Local Authority Social Care Services. It includes information on the numbers and characteristics of children in need and information on children who were the subject of a child protection plan for year ending March 2010.  This updates provisional information published in OSR24/2010 on 30 September 2010, as well as providing breakdowns of figures by new characteristics data for age, gender, ethnicity, disability, primary need, category of abuse, and reason for closure.

A copy of the guidance notes for the 2009-10 Children in Need data collection can be found at:

The Underlying Data File

Title: OSR28-2010.csv
File Headers:   See Annex A for a list of codes and headers
Coverage:  	Total for England provided for each variable
	        Total for each LA in England 

Variable names – A list of the headings used in the CSV file and the corresponding variable names are shown at Annex A.

Methodology

Data are returned form 152 LAs in England.

National totals are derived by summing data provided by each LA. In a number of cases where data is missing for a LA we have estimated the missing data. Detail on how this has been done is in paragraph 26 of the publication technical notes.

Due to the estimation required for missing data from individual LAs, no GOR totals have been totalled.

LA level data are data as returned by each LA and have been suppressed where necessary. 

Not all LAs had suitable data available. In some cases they provided aggregate figures, these are highlighted in the DCI columns by an 'A'. Footnotes to describe the individual situations for the LAs are in the publication tables.

Data Quality Indicator (DCI) values: '3' denotes high confidence, '2' denotes medium confidence, '1' denotes low confidence, 'A' denotes aggregate information was supplied by the Local Authority and '..' denotes no data was supplied/published. Further details on the construction of the indicator are in the publication technical notes, paragraphs 20 to 25.


Rounding and Suppression: National figures have been rounded to the nearest 100 as they include estimates for missing data. Any numbers between 1 and 5 inclusive (before rounding) have been suppressed and have been replaced by an ‘x’. Where there is a percentage reported and the difference between the numerator and denominator is between 1 and 5, the numerator and the denominator have been suppressed and replaced by a ‘x’. Where any number is shown as zero (0), the original figure submitted was zero. Where data were not submitted by a Local Authority ‘..’ has been used.
