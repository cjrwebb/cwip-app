“Characteristics of Children in Need, 2010-11, Final, OSR26-2011”


Background

This Statistical Release provides final figures on the numbers of children referred to and assessed by local authority social care services. It includes information on the numbers and characteristics of children in need and information on children who were the subject of a child protection plan for year ending March 2011. This updates provisional information published on 28 September 2011 (publication reference number OSR18/2011), as well as providing new breakdowns of figures by characteristics of age, gender, ethnicity, disability, primary need, category of abuse, and reason for closure.

A copy of the guidance notes for the 2010-11 Children in Need data collection can be found at:

The Underlying Data File

Title: OSR26-2011.csv
File Headers:   See Annex A for a list of codes and headers
Coverage:  	Total for England provided for each variable
	        Total for each LA in England 

Variable names – A list of the headings used in the CSV file and the corresponding variable names are shown at Annex A.

Methodology

Data are returned from 152 LAs in England. Where a full return could not be made aggregate figures were provided.

National totals are derived by summing data provided by each LA. In a number of cases where data is missing for a LA we have estimated the missing data. Detail on how this has been done is in paragraphs 23 and 24 of the publication technical notes.

LA level data are data as returned by each LA and have been suppressed where necessary. 

Not all LAs had suitable data available. In some cases they provided aggregate figures, these are highlighted in the DCI columns by an 'A'. Footnotes to describe the individual situations for the LAs are in the publication tables.

Data Quality Indicator (DCI) values: '3' denotes high confidence, '2' denotes medium confidence, '1' denotes low confidence, 'A' denotes aggregate information was supplied by the Local Authority and '..' denotes no data was supplied/published. Further details on the construction of the indicator are in the publication technical notes, paragraphs 15 to 21.

Rounding and Suppression: National and regional figures have been rounded to the nearest 100 or the nearest 10 as they include estimates for missing data. Any numbers between 1 and 5 inclusive (before rounding) have been suppressed and have been replaced by an ‘x’. Where there is a percentage reported and the difference between the numerator and denominator is between 1 and 5, the numerator and the denominator have been suppressed and replaced by an ‘x’. Where any number is shown as zero (0), the original figure submitted was zero. Where data were not submitted by a Local Authority ‘..’ has been used.
