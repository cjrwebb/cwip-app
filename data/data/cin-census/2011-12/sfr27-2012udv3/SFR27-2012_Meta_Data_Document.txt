“Characteristics of Children in Need, 2011-12, Final, SFR27-2012”
Background
This Statistical Release provides final figures on the numbers of children referred to and assessed by local authority social care services. It includes information on the numbers and characteristics of children in need and information on children who were the subject of a child protection plan for year ending March 2012. 
A copy of the guidance notes for the 2011-12 Children in Need data collection can be found at:

The Underlying Data File
Title: SFR27-2012.csv
File Headers:   See Annex A for a list of codes and headers
Coverage:  	Total for England provided for each variable
Total for each LA in England 
Variable names – A list of the headings used in the CSV file and the corresponding variable names are shown at Annex A.
Methodology
Data are returned from 150 LAs in England. No data were provided by Newham or Havering Local Authorities.
National totals are derived by summing data provided by each LA. In a number of cases where data is missing for a LA we have estimated the missing data. Detail on how this has been done is in paragraphs 23 and 24 of the publication technical notes.
LA level data are data as returned by each LA and have been suppressed where necessary. 
Data Quality Indicator (DCI) values: '3' denotes high confidence, '2' denotes medium confidence, '1' denotes low confidence, '..' denotes no data was supplied/published and ‘P’ denotes a local authority trialling pilot arrangements for assessments. Further details on the construction of the indicator are in section 4 of the document ‘SFR27/2012 Methodology document’.
Rounding and Suppression: National and regional figures have been rounded to the nearest 100 or the nearest 10 as they include estimates for missing data. Any numbers between 1 and 5 inclusive (before rounding) have been suppressed and have been replaced by an ‘x’. Where there is a percentage reported and the difference between the numerator and denominator is between 1 and 5, the numerator and the denominator have been suppressed and replaced by an ‘x’. Secondary suppression may be required in some cases. Where any number is shown as zero (0), the original figure submitted was zero. Where data were not submitted by a Local Authority ‘..’ has been used.
