The Underlying Data File
Title: SFR43-2014.csv
File Headers:   See Annex A for a list of codes and headers
Coverage:  	Total for England provided for each variable
Total for each local authority in England 
Variable names – A list of the headings used in the CSV file and the corresponding variable names are shown in Annex A.
Methodology
Data are returned from 152 local authorities in England.
National totals are derived by summing data provided by each local authority. In a number of cases where data is missing for a local authority we have estimated the missing data. Detail on how this has been done is in Section 5.1 of 'SFR43/2014 Methodology document’
Local authority level data are data as returned by each local authority and have been suppressed where necessary. 
Data Quality Indicator (DCI) values: '3' denotes high confidence, '2' denotes medium confidence, '1' denotes low confidence, '..' denotes no data was supplied/published, ‘P’ denotes a local authority trialling pilot arrangements for assessments and '.' denotes not applicable. Further details on the construction of the indicator are in section 4 of the document ‘SFR43/2014 Data quality and uses’.
Rounding and suppression: National and regional figures have been rounded to the nearest 100 or the nearest 10 as they include estimates for missing data. Any numbers between 1 and 5 inclusive (before rounding) have been suppressed and have been replaced by an ‘x’. Secondary suppression may be required in some cases. Where any number is shown as zero (0), the original figure submitted was zero. Where data were not submitted by a local authority ‘..’ has been used.
