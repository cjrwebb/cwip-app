Release of underlying data for SFR52/2016: “Characteristics of Children in Need: 2015 to 2016”

Background:

	This statistical first release (SFR) provides final figures on the numbers of children referred to and assessed by local authority social care services. It includes information on the numbers 
	and characteristics of children in need and information on children who were the subject of a child protection plan for year ending 31st March 2016. A copy of the guidance notes for the 2015-16 
	children in need data collection can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/children-in-need-census

The Underlying Data File:

	Title: 		SFR52_2016_UD.csv

	Coverage:  	Total for England provided for each variable
			Total for each local authority in England 

	Variable names:	A list of the headings used in the CSV file and the corresponding variable names are shown in Annex A.

Methodology:

	Data are returned from 152 local authorities in England. National totals are derived by summing data provided by each local authority. In a number of cases where data is missing for a local 
	authority we have estimated the missing data. Detail on how this has been done is in Section 5 of "Methodology document: SFR52/2016". Local authority level data are data as returned by each 
	local authority and have been suppressed where necessary. 

Rounding and suppression: 

	National figures have been rounded the nearest 10 as they include estimates for missing data. 
	Any number between 1 and 5 inclusive (before rounding), or a percentage based on these, has been suppressed and have been replaced by an ‘x’. 
	Secondary suppression has been carried out where necessary to preserve confidentiality.
	Where any number is shown as zero (0), the original figure submitted was zero. 	
	Where data were not submitted by a local authority ‘..’ has been used.
