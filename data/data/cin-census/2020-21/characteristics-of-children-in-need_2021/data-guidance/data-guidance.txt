Characteristics of children in need
2021 Reporting Year

Description

Children in need statistics provide information on:

- children in need of social care services;
- children referred to social care services;
- assessments undertaken, primary need at assessment and factors identified at the end of assessment;
- section 47 enquiries (carried out by a local authority if they suspect a child is suffering, or likely to suffer, significant harm) and initial child protection conferences;
- children who were the subject of a child protection plan.

Coverage

Data is collected by the Department for Education in the annual Children in need Census from all local authorities in England.

Data for Hackney local authority is not available for the year ending 31 March 2021.

File formats and conventions

Confidentiality

0 indicates the original figure submitted was zero.

Any number between 1 and 5 inclusive has been suppressed and replaced by ‘c’.  Secondary suppression has been applied where necessary, to preserve confidentiality.

The letter ‘z’ indicates data is not applicable.

The symbol ‘:’ indicates that data is not available. This may be because a local authority was unable to return a particular data item in the children in need census; changes to the data collected in the census; or data is not available because of concerns regarding quality.

The symbols used are in accordance with the latest Government Statistical Service (GSS) guidance.

Rounding

England and regional totals are rounded to the nearest 10 and therefore totals may not equal the sum of their component parts.

Percentages are rounded to one decimal place, therefore component parts may not sum to 100.

Rates per 10,000 children aged under 18 years are rounded to one decimal place. Rates are calculated using ONS mid-year population estimates for children aged 0 to 17 years in England.

Footnotes:

1. Rates per 10,000 of the population of children aged under 18 years are calculated using Office for National Statistics (ONS) mid-year population estimates for children aged 0 to 17 years in England.
2. There is significant variation between local authorities in the number of referrals which resulted in no further action without an assessment taking place. This variation is a result of differences in local reporting practices.
3. There is significant variation between local authorities in the number of referrals which resulted in assessment where the child was assessed as not in need and no further action was taken after the assessment. This variation is a result of differences in local reporting practices.
4. If a child has more than one referral in a reporting year, then each referral is counted.
5. Data for the year ending 31 March 2021 is not available for Hackney local authority, therefore 2020 data for Hackney has been included in the 2021 national totals and regional totals for inner London and London. Refer to the methodology section for more information.

2. An assessment may have more than one factor recorded.
3. Information on child on child and adult on child physical and sexual abuse was collected and reported on for the first time in 2021 and so should be treated with some caution. Previously physical abuse and sexual abuse was collected and reported on (irrespective of whether it was child on child or adult on child) and some local authorities provided information on the old basis only, or a mixture of the old and new basis, in 2021. The old physical and sexual abuse categories have therefore been included in the 2021 data to provide a more complete account of this category of assessment.
4. Data for the year ending 31 March 2021 is not available for Hackney local authority, therefore 2020 data for Hackney has been included in the 2021 national totals and regional totals for inner London and London. Refer to the methodology section for more information.
