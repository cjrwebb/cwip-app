The CWIP App is in beta. Please submit any feedback, questions, and bugs to <a href = "mailto:c.j.webb@sheffield.ac.uk">c.j.webb@sheffield.ac.uk</a>, or [log an issue on Github](https://github.com/cjrwebb/cwip-app). Please check the Issues section below to see if the issue you're reporting has already been submitted.

Please cite the CWIP App as *Webb, C. & Thomas, R. (2020). The Child Welfare Inequalities Project App. www.cwip-app.co.uk*. Please email me with any details on how you have used the CWIP App, this way I can evidence its impact and justify future funding.

To read the full report about the findings from the Child Welfare Inequalities Project and other outputs, [click here](https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/project/inequalities-in-child-welfare-intervention-rates). This report frames the theoretical and academic interpretation of many features in children's services data. You may also benefit from reading the final report from Rick Hood, et al.'s Nuffield Foundation funded project: ["Identifying and understanding the link between system conditions and welfare inequalities in childrenâ€™s social care services"](https://www.healthcare.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/System-conditions-and-inequalities_Full-report_Final_March-2020.pdf).

The purpose of the CWIP App is to increase the accessibility of government data related to children's services through consolidated data sets and web-based data visualisation, including for quite complex data processing and visualisation procedures. We think if more people, including people with lived experience and frontline practitioners who are usually excluded from discussions about trends and features in data, have better access to this data there can be better activism and accountability on behalf of children, families, and the social work profession. Click on one of the features on the left-hand side to start exploring data.

All data has been sourced from public government data releases. Some data comes from my own archives of public government data, as the Department for Education frequently removes older data. Most data has been transformed, aggregated or disaggregated in some way, by me and where descriptions try to be as clear as possible and all data and code is made openly available for checking on github, you should use caution and double-check any rates, the most up-to-date data, and the internal calculations if using them to inform a critical decision. The full list of sources includes:

* Data from the Department for Education: 
  * Children in Need Census
  * Children looked-after statistics
  * Section 251 Returns
* Data from the Office of National Statistics and Nomis (Census and Population estimates)
* Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2019 and 2015
* 2011 Census relating to Ethnicity
* Life Expectancy at Birth (2009-2013)
* Median House Price (2017 & 2018)
* Journey Time Statistics for Key Services (2017)
* Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards (AHAH) 2017
* StatsWales
* Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency
* Northern Ireland Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2017
* Scottish Indices of Multiple Deprivation & Indicators 2020
* Scottish Census Data (2011)

It was only possible to create this app thanks to the people behind R Shiny, RStudio, as well as many other R package authors and the wider community. The code was written by me, and is not the highest quality, as I am not a programmer/data scientist (and in many ways this is testament to how amazing R, Shiny, the tidyverse and the R community is). All code used to read data sources, calculate transformations, program the app, and the data itself is available on Github: [https://github.com/cjrwebb/cwip-app](https://github.com/cjrwebb/cwip-app)

<summary>Click to show issues</summary>

* <strike>Cannot install waffle plots from github using `devtools::install_github`, which prevents installing `waffle` > 0.7.0 for spending waffle plots. Temporarily hidden spending waffle plots. </strike> SOLVED BY CHANGING `Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS="true")`

* <strike>Fixed Waffle plots, but cannot display these in Shiny app. Problem with Font Awesome 5 library or with waffle package? Can't see immediate fix and will wait until waffle > 0.70 is on CRAN.</strike> Fixed by installing fonts to .fonts on shinyapps.io deployment.

* England Average label on trendplots can occassionally obscure LA label.
